# QSelect

QSelect is a utility I wrote to tidy up my Quake folder and make launching custom content easier. It turns an entire folder of content folders, batch files, executables, et cetera, into just a few files.

# Features

 - Splits game binaries and game content into separate directories, allowing for a much cleaner structure.
 - Allows easy launching of downloaded game content - no more batch files!
 - Synchronises config.cfg between content folders so your settings stay the same.
 - Support for virtually any Quake client, as it emulates how vanilla Quake loads content.
 - Remembers which content you played last and allows it to be run immediately.
 - Allows aliases for custom content (e.g. "dopa" is displayed as Dimensions of the Past)
 - Configurable via a JSON file.
